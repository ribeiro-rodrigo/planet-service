# Planet Service
Sample project that demonstrates the use of Safira as a dependency injection container in Node.js. projects. <br/>

Planet Service is a small REST API based on some information from the Star Wars franchise. It is possible to register, list and remove planets.
The official Star Wars API was used to obtain the number of participations in films from a given planet when it is registered.

The project was presented in the [article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/inje%C3%A7%C3%A3o-de-depend%C3%AAncia-nodejs-com-safira-rodrigo-ribeiro/).
